About pyo
=================

Pyo is a Python module written in C to help digital signal processing script 
creation. It provides a complete set of classes to build audio softwares, 
compose algorithmic musics or simply explore audio processing with a simple, 
mature and powerful programming language.

Pyo contains 
classes for a wide variety of audio signal processing. With pyo, the user will 
be able to include signal processing chains directly in Python scripts or 
projects, and to manipulate them in real time through the interpreter. Tools 
in the pyo module offer primitives, like mathematical operations on audio 
signals, basic signal processing (filters, delays, synthesis generators, etc.), 
but also complex algorithms to create sound granulation and other creative 
audio manipulations. pyo supports the OSC protocol (Open Sound Control) to ease 
communications between softwares, and the MIDI protocol for generating sound 
events and controlling process parameters. pyo allows the creation of 
sophisticated signal processing chains with all the benefits of a mature and 
widely used general programming language. 

Pyo is developed by Olivier BÃ©langer < belangeo@gmail.com >
